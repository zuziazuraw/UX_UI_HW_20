  <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-4" >ABOUT THE PROJECT</h4>
  <div>
  <h5>Black Lives Matter is a global organization, whose mission is to actively dismantle all forms of anti-Black racism and white supremacy.  BLM aims to build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities. For more information on how you can support Black Lives Matter Canada, have a look at their website <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.ca/"> here. </a> 
  </h5>
  <h5 class="mb-5">Due to the traction that the website is currently receiveing, we wanted to provide BLM Canada with a reliable and website to help generate more traffic and a steady flow of donations. Organizing the information would also help in educating the masses on the systemic racism within our society.</h5>

<div class="mx-5">
  <h4 class="font-weight-bold my-4" >THE CHALLENGE</h4>
  <div>
    <h5>One of the main considerations I took into account in the redesign was that Black Lives Matter is unapologetic in their fight for justice, to which some may label them as an extreme activist group. 
    </a>  </h5>
    <h5 class="mb-5">    
      The main challenge was to redesign BLM Canada's current website layout into a reliable collection of information, where users could learn and appreciate the movement and  not feel intimidated by the content. Organizing the information would also help in effortlessly educating Canadians on the systemic racism present within our own communities, a topic that is crucial for us to learn about in order to dismantle institutional racism in our society.</h5>

  <h4 class="font-weight-bold my-4" >REASEARCH</h4>
  <div>
    <h5>Usability testing helped establish which features are most benefitial to site users. Most were compelled by the bold imagery and colour used throughout the website, so it was defiently something we wanted to incorporate in our redesign. 
    </a>  </h5>
    <div> <img class="mx-auto d-block mb-5 mt-5 img-fluid" src="assets/images/blmresearch.png"></div>
    <h5 class="mb-5">    
      We quickly learned during data synthesis that there were certain obsticles when it came to navigating the sites hierarchy, for example, there was no search bar visible in the navigation. Users were also a quite lost when it came to the oranization of the content within the navigation bar and each site itself. It then because clear that the information archecture needed redeveloping. </h5>

  <h4 class="font-weight-bold my-4 pt-5" >SOLUTIONS</h4>
  <div>
    <h5>We know that many users are coming to the site to better understand what the movement stands for, and itâ€™s important that that information is clearly displayed to users to convey the feeling of transparency a non-profit organization should have. Making the mission clear on the homepage helps establish what Black Lives Matter is about. </h5>

    <h5>In conducting a card sorting for the main navigation, we were able to create a user-friendly navigation. We simplified the navigation items in a more cohesive manner, such as combining the "Defund the Police- Demands" and "Demands" pages into one, all while still highlighting the importance of defunding the police. Since the site is content heavy, we also threw in that search bar for users to freely search and resources they may need. </h5>
    <div> <img class="mx-auto d-block mb-5 mt-5 img-fluid" src="assets/images/wireframes.png"></div>

    <h5 class="mb-5">    
      When exploring the other chapters of the Black Lives Matter movement, we noticed that BLM Canada was not consistent with the brand. To make certain information pop, we added the bold, signature yellow and the Cornerstone font found within the other chapters.
      <br>We made sure all of the design elements were consistent with each other on each site.     </h5>
      <div> <img class="mx-auto d-block mb-5 mt-5 img-fluid" src="assets/images/fontblm'.png"></div>

    <h5 class="mb-5"> To make the layout digestible to users, many elements were incorporated to keep the user engaged. Data from the usability testing found the new layout design to be organized, clean and professional. </h5>
